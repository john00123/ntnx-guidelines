# Website Illustration Guidelines

### Color

  
Never use colors beyond this palette, or alter the opacity of colors / strokes. The first and second row are used for motion lines and floor guides.

### Stroke

​​When using color, be wary of any connotations that certain shades may have; the majority of illustrations will have a grey base. The majority of illustrations can be created using a stroke width of 2 pixels.

| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/stroke-1.svg) | ​​Use lighter strokes to add detail within objects where appropriate. |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/stroke-2.svg) | Use standard dashed strokes settings to show motion trails and lines connecting objects. |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/stroke-3.svg) | For strokes on the floor plane, use lighter shades; with dashed lines being a shade darker than solid lines \(see ‘Color’, \(2\) \). |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/stroke-4.svg) | Avoid harsh edges for connecting vertices or for separating surfaces of softer objects. |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/stroke-5.svg) | Use lighter shades when connecting objects or alluding to a form of assembly / structure. |
