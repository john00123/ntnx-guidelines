#### Best practices

* Make sure that to use colors with similar tonality. Nutanix **Neutral Palette** has blue a base, so combining with regular desaturated colors can break to harmony between between them. Make sure to reference you Color equation section, to learn more about how these colors were derived.
* Try to minimize the use of too many different tonalities in a single page.
