### Logos inside Product

Logos are exposed inside the top navigation they work better on a [Dark-grey-1](primitives/colors/#neutral-palette) background. Additionally, can also be used on light colored backgrounds. For light backgrounds, the logo should always be a derivative of [Blue-1](primitives/colors/#blue-palette).
