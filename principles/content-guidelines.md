## Voice and Tone

What’s the difference between voice and tone? You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. Your tone changes based on who you are talking to while it also changes based on the emotional state of the person you are addressing.

### Our voice is "Insightful"

• Write like this: We recommend you to optimize these 5 cloud instances and save $400.  
• Not like this: You can optimize resources and save.  
• Why? We provide insightful information and enable action.

### Our voice is "Uncluttered"

• Write like this: Edit cost policy to change default settings.  
• Not like this: You are viewing the data of last three months because of default settings. To see specific data, you need to change the cost policy.  
• Why? We do away with wordy messages, and get right to the useful parts.

### Our voice is "Trustworthy"

• Write like this: Auto-rebuild in progress, it will take 24-48 hours. No action is required meanwhile.  
• Not like this: System is processing.  
• Why? We inform the user, never leave them at a dead-end.

Our tone suits the context as well as the reader’s state of mind. We are:   
• honest, but not aggressive  
• fun but not silly   
• helpful but not overbearing

## Components

### Buttons

An ideal button labeling has a {verb} + {noun} structure. A verb indicates the button is actionable while giving the idea about what to expect.  


Avoid generic labels like “OK”, “Cancel”, “Done” for buttons.  


**Do:** Add Funds, View Usage  
**Don’t:** Add, View  


**Create vs Add:** Use “Add” when user is adding to an existing data set and “Create” when something is being created from scratch.  


### Links

Links can be used to redirect the user to a resource, section, etc. Link the resource, and not the entire sentence. Avoid using “click here” as link text.

**Do:** You can choose to disable auto renewal.  
**Don’t:** Click here to disable auto renewal.

Add context to where the link will redirect.

**Do:** Know more about our price calculator.  
**Don’t:** Know more.

### Error Messages

Error messages are one of the most critical parts of designing an experience. As a general thumb rule frame an error message as {problem} + {cause of error} + {solution}.

**Do:** Provide appropriate actions that can be routes to solve the problem.  
Be humble. Speak it aloud like you are explaining someone.  
Disclose information progressively.

**Don’t:** Use technical jargon.  
Use exclamation marks.  
Imply that the error is users fault.  
Use negative words like “Access denied”.

### Confirmation Messages

Even though confirmation messages can act as friction when a user is trying to perform an action, they are very efficient in improving the user experience. Confirmation messages are used to “confirm” with the users if they want to proceed with an action or cancel.

**Do:** Present the action in the header.

Explain the outcome in the body.

Reinstate the action with the button.

**Don’t:** Be repetitive.

Ask vague questions like “Are you sure?”

Be vague about action buttons.

### Forms

#### Headings and Field Labels

Group headings and field labels logically to allow easier visual scanning.  
Do: Use title style capitalizations.  
Don’t: Don’t use headings that are unnecessarily long.

#### Placeholder Text

This is the light text that appears within a field label and disappears when data is entered in the field.  


Don’t: Don’t place text which user will need to memorize for cross-verifying after he/she has entered the data as a placeholder text.![](../.gitbook/assets/1%20%281%29.png)

Do: Place text that user might need after filling the field as notes.

![](../.gitbook/assets/2%20%282%29.png)

Don’t: Avoid repeating the field labels and excessive usage of please as placeholder text.

![](../.gitbook/assets/3%20%282%29.png)

  
Do: Use action-oriented placeholder text in sentence style capitalization.

![](../.gitbook/assets/4%20%282%29.png)

#### Notes

This is the related subtext below the field labels. Use them to provide notes or instructions to fill the field label.

Do: If the instruction is too long or consists of the definition of the field label, try disclosing it progressively.

![](../.gitbook/assets/5.png)

Try wording the link as a question a user would ask himself/herself while filling it.

### Tables

Always right-align a block or column of whole numbers or of whole numbers and text. Align numbers at the decimal point \(or imaginary decimal point if there are only whole numbers\).

## Grammar and Syntax

###  Active vs. Passive Voice

Use active voice rather than passive voice. It increases readability and decreases ambiguity. In active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. When using passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.

**Do:** Nutanix sent the email.  
**Don’t:** The email was sent by Nutanix.

Don’t know whether you’re using active or passive voice? Look for words such as “was” and “by” - they typically indicate that you’re writing in passive voice. One exception is when you want to specifically emphasize the action over the subject. In some cases, this is fine.

**Do:** Your account was flagged by our abuse team.

### Capitalization

Use title style capitalization for all titles i.e tile, popups, menu, tab, actions, labels, etc. Capitalize every word except:

• Articles \(a, an, the\)

• Coordinating conjunctions \(and, or, of\)

• Prepositions of four or fewer letters.

Exception: When the preposition is part of a verb phrase, as in “Starting Up the Computer.”

</table>### Time and Date

#### Relative Timestamps

Relative timestamps display the number of minutes, hours, days, weeks or years ago an action took place. Use relative timestamps when immediacy is more important than accuracy. Don’t make the user count back from the present day.

**Do:** Last updated 2 hours ago  
**Don’t:** Last updated at 14:40:34 PM

#### Absolute timestamps

Absolute timestamps display the exact date and time an action took place.  Use absolute timestamps when users can go back and make use of the past content.

**Do:** Last snapshot taken at 14:40:00 PM  
**Don’t:** Last snapshot taken 2 hours ago

#### Dates

If the date is within the current calendar year, don’t show the year. Use the MLA style for abbreviating months.

**Do:** Aug 4, 2019

Sept 4, 2019

YYYY-MM-DD

**Don’t:** 4 Aug 2018

Aug 4th, 2018 

MM/DD/YYYY

#### Dates and Time

To display a date or time range, show an em dash \(without spaces\) between a range of dates or times.

**Do:** 9:00 AM–10:00 PM

**Don’t:** 9:00AM – 10:00PM

Mention the year only at the end if both the dates fall in the same year. Use AM/PM only once if both are same.

**Do:** Dec 6, 2013–Jan 2, 2014

**Don’t:** January 4–6, 2014  
**Do:** 9:00–10:00 AM

**Don’t:** 9:00 AM–10:00 AM

#### Dates, Time, and Timezones

If indicating a time zone is necessary, use the time zone’s abbreviation and separate it with the word "at", rather than with a comma  
**Do:** Feb 4, 2019 at 4:00 PM UTC

**Don’t:** Feb 4,2019, 4:00PM\(UTC\)

#### 

#### Abbreviations

Use abbreviations when there are space constraints. In general, abbreviations are used as singular.

**Do:** 5 min ago  
**Don’t:** 5 mins ago

### Numbers

When a sentence begins with a number, spell it out. All other times, write the number using digits. Use commas in numbers larger than 3 digits and use abbreviations only if you have space constraints.

  
**Do**: This action will upgrade 3 clusters.

Three clusters will be upgraded with this action.

  
**Don’t:** This action will upgrade three clusters.

3 clusters will be upgraded with this action.

  
**Do:** 1,567

**Don’t:** 1567

  
Write out big numbers in full. Abbreviate them only if there are space restraints \(for example, 1k, 150k\).

#### Numbers with Units

Place the unit label after the numerical value, and insert a space between the numerical value and the unit label.

  
**Do:** This feature requires at least 14 GB of memory.

**Don’t:** This feature requires at least 14GB of memory.

  
This rule applies even when the value of a quantity is used as an adjective.

**Do:** This node has a 3 GHz CPU.

**Don’t:** This node has a 3-GHz CPU.

### Punctuations

#### Ampersands

They attract attention to the least important part of the sentence. Spell out the word “and”.  


**Do:** Data Protection and Recovery  
**Don’t:** Data Protection & Recovery

#### Colons

Use a colon to call out a list. Don’t use an ellipsis, em dash, or comma.  


**Do:** Nutanix supports three hypervisors: AHV, ESX, and Hyper-V.

**Don’t:** Nutanix supports three hypervisors — AHV, ESX, and Hyper-V.

  
Don’t use colon to introduce radio buttons or checklists.

**Don’t:**  
Select a network:

• 30TB-Centos-11

• 4.602-Prism-Central

#### Commas

In general, use commas whenever the sentence requires a pause. One technique is to read the sentence out loud. Where you find yourself taking a breath, use a comma.

When writing lists, use the Oxford comma.

  
**Do:** Nutanix supports three hypervisors: AHV, ESX, and Hyper-V.

**Don’t:** Nutanix supports three hypervisors: AHV, ESX and Hyper-V.

#### Dashes and Hyphens

Use them without spaces on either side to link words into single phrase, or to indicate a span or range.

**Do:** first-time login, scale-out, Monday-Friday

#### Em-Dashes

Use an em dash only if you can’t make your message clearer by splitting it into two sentences. Use an em dash without a space on either side \(—\).

#### Periods

Absolutely avoid using periods if it’s not a full sentence. Don’t use periods in headings and titles, placeholder texts, notifications, radio and checkbox options, hover and tooltip.

![](../.gitbook/assets/7.png)

#### Question Marks

Is the question mark really necessary? Reword into affirmative statements wherever you can. Don’t ask questions if it is the only option.

  
**Do:** Reset password

**Don’t:** Reset password?

### Entity and File Names

#### Entity Names

When you refer to any named entity in a sentence, reference it by name. Using the name will help orient the user, especially when performing actions on the entity. Surround the entity name with quotation marks.

  
**Do:** The storage container “CTR1” has 57 VMs on it.

#### File Extensions

  
Use all uppercase letters without a period to indicate the file type. Add a lowercase “s” to make it plural. While referring a specific file, use the exact spelling and capitalization of the actual file. When in doubt, use lowercase.

  
**Do:** ZIP, PDF, HTML, JPGs

**Do:** boot.qcow2, 4.5-prism\_central.ova, 4.6-Community\_Edition.zip

#### Exporting Content

  
When exporting content out of Prism, it often ends up as a file stored on the user’s local system. When designing an experience around exporting files out of of a system, a clear and simple strategy for handling those files becomes an important part of the system usability.

  
File names should be short and descriptive. Names should convey an understanding of the contents of the file, without making the user view the contents of the file.

  
**Don’t:** file-export.nset

**Don’t:** Puppyfood-pulse-smtp-and-remote-access-settings-2017-02-25.nset

**Do:** Puppyfood-settings-2017-02-25.nset

#### Append the date

Each downloaded file should include the date at the end of the file name. The date should correspond to the date the file was downloaded. For example: “Puppyfood-settings-2017-02-25.nset”.

#### Use hyphens as separators

The hyphen is the accepted standard for separating words. Do not use spaces \(which cause problems for some systems, or become replaced with “%20”\) or underscores \(which can disappear if underlined as a hyperlink\).

#### Use lowercase

Since some systems are case-insensitive, do not rely on CamelCasing in filenames. Use all lowercase.

#### Provide a name, don’t ask for one

Don’t provide a mechanism for the user to name the file within Prism. Users have the freedom to rename files once they are downloaded. Adding this step in Prism provides little value, at the cost of adding another step to the user’s workflow.

### Spellings and Formatting

#### Spellings

Cross-check and double-check the spellings.Use American spellings for all the content on the interface.If in doubt, refer the [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) dictionary.

  
**Do:** Use color, license, utilize

**Don’t:** Use colour, licence, utilise

  
You can also refer our [word list](http://nutanix.design/2.0/#ContentGuidelines_WordList) when in doubt.

#### Contractions

Use contractions like you’ll and we’ll. Avoid negative contractions like can’t and don’t - many users find them harder to read, or misread them as the opposite of what they say.

**Do:** Data Protection and Recovery cannot be enabled.

**Don’t:** You can’t enable Data Protection and Recovery.

#### Formatting

Use bold sparingly and only where strong emphasis is required.

**Do:** Your profile has been successfully updated.  
**Don’t:** Your profile has been successfully updated.
