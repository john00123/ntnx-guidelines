## Voice and Tone

What’s the difference between voice and tone? You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. Your tone changes based on who you are talking to while it also changes based on the emotional state of the person you are addressing.

### Voice

#### Our voice is "Insightful"

We provide insightful information and enable action.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Use** language like this: We recommend you to optimize these 5 cloud instances and save $400.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Avoid** writing like this: You can optimize resources and save.
{% endhint %}

#### Our voice is "Uncluttered"

We do away with wordy messages, and get right to the useful parts.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Use** language like this: Edit cost policy to change default settings.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Avoid** writing like this: You are viewing the data of last three months because of default settings. To see specific data, you need to change the cost policy.
{% endhint %}

#### Our voice is "Trustworthy"

We inform the user, never leave them at a dead-end.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Use** language like this: Auto-rebuild in progress, it will take 24-48 hours. No action is required meanwhile.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Avoid** writing like this: System is processing.
{% endhint %}



### Tone

Our tone suits the context as well as the reader’s state of mind. We are:   
• Honest, but not aggressive  
• Fun but not silly   
• Helpful but not overbearing
