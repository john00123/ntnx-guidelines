# Voice and Tone

What’s the difference between voice and tone? You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. Your tone changes based on who you are talking to while it also changes based on the emotional state of the person you are addressing.

  
**Our voice is "Insightful"**

• Write like this: We recommend you to optimize these 5 cloud instances and save $400.  
• Not like this: You can optimize resources and save.  
• Why? We provide insightful information and enable action.

**Our voice is "Uncluttered"**

• Write like this: Edit cost policy to change default settings.  
• Not like this: You are viewing the data of last three months because of default settings. To see specific data, you need to change the cost policy.  
• Why? We do away with wordy messages, and get right to the useful parts.

**Our voice is "Trustworthy"**

• Write like this: Auto-rebuild in progress, it will take 24-48 hours. No action is required meanwhile.  
• Not like this: System is processing.  
• Why? We inform the user, never leave them at a dead-end.

Fun but not silly   
Helpful but not overbearing**
