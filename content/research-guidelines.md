# Research Guidelines

Research provides the inspiration, guidance, and validation we need to design great products. From the personal \(like interviewing users\) to the analytical \(like metrics\) there’s a continuum of research skills that are essential for design teams. The most effective companies integrate this discipline into their culture and make research a habit.

This is our guide to design research.

**Talking to users**

[**Why you only need to test with five users**](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html)  
_Jakob Nielsen, Nielsen Norman Group_  
Optimize your research for speed and value by running small tests more often. Five users is a sweet spot.

[**Thinking aloud: The \#1 usability tool**](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/thinking-aloud-tests.html)  
_Jakob Nielsen, Nielsen Norman Group_  
Simple usability tests where users think aloud are highly effective. They are also cheap, flexible, and easy to learn.

[**Focus groups are worthless**](https://medium.com/@mulegirl/focus-groups-are-worthless-7d30891e58f1)  
_Erika Hall, Mule Design_  
Group dynamics get in the way of meaningful learning. Don’t use a focus group in place of real customer interviews.
